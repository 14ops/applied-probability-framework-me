- Mode selection (mines/trading/both)
- Quick test mode
- Progress tracking

### 5. Documentation ✅
**File:** `README_TRAINING.md`

**Features:**
- Complete usage guide
- Configuration examples
- Quick start instructions
- Troubleshooting section

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Training (Recommended)

```bash
# Quick test (fast, good for first run)
python src/python/train_bot_simulator.py

# Or use the run script
python run_training.py --quick
```

### View Results

Results saved to `results/` directory:
- `training_log_TIMESTAMP.csv` - Per-round profits
- `decisions_TIMESTAMP.csv` - All decisions made
- `strategy_evolution_TIMESTAMP.json` - Final character configs
