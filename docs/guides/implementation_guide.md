## Implemented High-Impact Changes

This section details the implementation of the top 6 high-impact changes as outlined in the project roadmap, enhancing the framework's capabilities in data logging, Bayesian estimation, simulation comparison, money management, meta-control, and CI/CD.

### 1. Event Logger (`python-backend/src/logger.py`)

**Description:** A new module `logger.py` has been created to capture real session data in a structured JSON Lines format. This logger records critical game parameters such as timestamp, grid state, mine count, clicks, payout, and win/loss status for each session.

**Purpose:** This data is crucial for calibrating simulations, detecting model drift, and feeding Bayesian updates, providing a robust foundation for data-driven strategy refinement.

**Implementation Details:**
*   **File:** `python-backend/src/logger.py`
*   **Functionality:** Contains a `log_session(session)` function that appends a JSON representation of each game session to `logs/sessions.jsonl`.
*   **Usage:** Designed to be integrated into the live runner to emit data for every completed round.

### 2. Bayesian Click Estimator + Fractional Kelly (`python-backend/src/bayesian.py`)

**Description:** A core mathematical upgrade, `bayesian.py` introduces a `BetaEstimator` for robust click success probability estimation and a `fractional_kelly` function for optimized bet sizing.

**Purpose:** This module reduces overbetting on noisy estimates by providing a more statistically sound approach to probability assessment and risk management, crucial for long-term strategy effectiveness.

**Implementation Details:**
*   **File:** `python-backend/src/bayesian.py`
*   **`BetaEstimator` Class:** Implements a Beta posterior distribution to update click success probabilities based on observed wins and losses, exposing mean and confidence intervals.
*   **`fractional_kelly` Function:** Calculates the optimal fraction of the bankroll to bet, based on win probability (`p`), net odds (`b`), and an adjustable fraction (`f`), preventing ruin and maximizing long-term growth.

### 3. Simulator-to-Live Comparator (`python-backend/src/sim_compare.py`)

**Description:** This module provides a mechanism to compare the performance of simulated game sessions against real-world logged sessions.

**Purpose:** To validate that the simulator accurately reflects reality within acceptable tolerances (e.g., 5â€“10%), ensuring that insights derived from simulations are applicable to actual gameplay.

**Implementation Details:**
*   **File:** `python-backend/src/sim_compare.py`
*   **Functionality:** Reads `logs/sessions.jsonl`, re-runs simulations with the same parameters, and compares key metrics (mean, variance, skew) and distributions (using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) between live and simulated data.
*   **Outcome:** Provides statistical evidence of simulator fidelity or highlights discrepancies requiring recalibration.

### 4. Refined Strategy Implementations with Conservative Fractional Kelly

**Description:** Existing strategy implementations have been updated to incorporate the `fractional_kelly` function from `bayesian.py` for bet sizing, with an added layer of conservatism based on the confidence interval (CI) width of the probability estimates.

**Purpose:** To reduce ruin risk by dynamically adjusting the Kelly fraction. If the confidence interval width of the win probability estimate is high (indicating greater uncertainty), a more conservative fraction is used.

**Implementation Details:**
*   **Files Modified:** `python-backend/src/strategies.py` (specifically `BasicStrategy`), and the dummy strategies within `meta_controller.py` (`AggressiveStrategy`, `ConservativeStrategy`).
*   **Logic:** Each strategy now calculates `p_win` and `ci_width` from its `BetaEstimator`. The Kelly fraction `f` is set to a lower value (e.g., 0.1) if `ci_width > 0.15`, otherwise a default (e.g., 0.25 or 0.4) is used.

### 5. Implement Meta-Controller using Thompson Sampling (`python-backend/src/meta_controller.py`)

**Description:** The `meta_controller.py` module has been enhanced to implement a meta-controller that dynamically selects the best-performing strategy using Thompson Sampling.

**Purpose:** This adaptive approach allows the system to intelligently switch between different strategies based on their observed performance, maximizing overall expected value over time, much like a seasoned strategist adapting their tactics mid-battle.

**Implementation Details:**
*   **File:** `python-backend/src/meta_controller.py`
*   **`StrategyManager` Class:** Manages multiple strategies, each with its own `BetaEstimator`. It samples from each strategy's Beta posterior distribution, multiplies by an expected payout, and selects the strategy with the highest sampled value.
*   **Update Mechanism:** The `update_performance` method now implicitly relies on the individual strategies updating their own `BetaEstimator` based on game outcomes.

### 6. CI, Tests, and Reproducible Simulations

**Description:** Continuous Integration (CI) has been set up using GitHub Actions, and a deterministic simulation test has been introduced to ensure code quality and reproducibility.

**Purpose:** To automate testing, catch regressions early, and guarantee that simulation results are consistent and reproducible, which is fundamental for scientific validation and reliable development.

**Implementation Details:**
*   **CI Workflow:** A `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file has been created to:
    *   Set up Python 3.11.
    *   Install project dependencies.
    *   Run unit tests (placeholder `pytest python-backend/tests/` command).
    *   Run a deterministic simulation test.
*   **Deterministic Simulation Script:** `python-backend/run_deterministic_sim.py` executes a simulation with a fixed RNG seed, asserting that key metrics (final bankroll, win rate, max drawdown) remain within expected tolerances. This ensures that changes to the codebase do not inadvertently alter the core simulation behavior.
*   **Testing Documentation:** The `testing_and_validation.md` file has been expanded to include procedures for K-Fold Backtesting and Stress Tests, providing guidelines for comprehensive validation beyond basic unit tests.
