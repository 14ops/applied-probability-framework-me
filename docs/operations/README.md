# Operations & Runbooks

The files in this directory collect practical checklists for day-to-day operations. They were previously spread across the repository root, making it difficult to prepare a paper-trading session quickly.

## Runbooks

- [PAPER_TRADING_CHECKLIST.md](PAPER_TRADING_CHECKLIST.md) – Step-by-step validation before enabling any live or paper-trading routine.
- [PAPER_TRADING_READY.md](PAPER_TRADING_READY.md) – Final readiness confirmation once all prerequisite tasks are complete.

Consult these references before switching environments or running production-like experiments to ensure that nothing critical is overlooked.
