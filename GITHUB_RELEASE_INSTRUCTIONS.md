## 🎯 Best Practices

### Before Creating the Release:

- ✅ Test the executable thoroughly
- ✅ Update version numbers in code
- ✅ Update CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ Ensure README.md is up to date
- ✅ Commit all changes

### Release Naming Convention:

- Use semantic versioning: `v1.0.0`
- Format: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Example: `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, `v2.0.0`

### Release Notes Should Include:

- ✅ What's new in this version
- ✅ System requirements
- ✅ Download instructions
- ✅ Usage examples
- ✅ Known issues
- ✅ How to report bugs

---

## 📊 Monitoring Your Release

After publishing, you can track:

- **Download count**: See how many times the release has been downloaded
- **Traffic**: Check the Insights → Traffic section
- **Issues**: Monitor issues related to the release

---

## 🔄 Updating a Release

If you need to update the release:

1. Go to the release page
2. Click "Edit release"
3. Upload new files or update notes
4. Click "Update release"

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "File too large" error:
- GitHub has a 2 GB limit per file
- Your file is 20 MB, so this shouldn't be an issue
- If needed, use Git LFS for larger files

### Can't push tag:
```powershell
# Force push (use carefully)
git push origin v1.0.0 --force
```

### Delete and recreate tag:
```powershell
# Delete local tag
git tag -d v1.0.0

# Delete remote tag
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0

# Create new tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```
