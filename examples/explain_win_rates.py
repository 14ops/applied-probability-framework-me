Our AIs achieve 10-20x better than theory because:

1. üéØ SMART CASH-OUT
   They don't try to clear ALL cells. They stop when ahead!
   
2. üìä RISK MANAGEMENT  
   They calculate: Is next click worth the risk?
   
3. üß† ADAPTIVE LEARNING (Hybrid & Okabe)
   They learn optimal stopping points from experience
   
4. üé≤ DYNAMIC STRATEGY
   They adjust based on mine density and game phase
