# Applied Probability and Automation Framework for High-RTP Games

**A Research + Engineering Hybrid Project**

This repository contains the complete source code, documentation, and research materials for a sophisticated framework designed to analyze and automate betting strategies in high-Return-to-Player (RTP) games. The project integrates theoretical probability analysis with practical software engineering to create an adaptive, multi-component system.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The framework is composed of three main components, each housed in a dedicated directory:

1.  **Backend (Python):** The analytical engine for game simulation, strategy execution, and data analysis.
2.  **Frontend (Interactive Dashboard):** A modern web-based interface for configuration, control, and real-time visualization of results.
3.  **GUI (Java):** A legacy Java-based control panel, included for historical and academic completeness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/14ops/applied-probability-framework-shihab-belal.git
    cd applied-probability-framework-shihab-belal
    ```
2.  **Set up the Python Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd backend/python
    python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Quick smoke test (optional deps are handled gracefully)
    python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '$(pwd)'); from src.main import main; main()"
    ```
3.  **Set up the Interactive Dashboard:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend/dashboard
    npm install
    npm run dev
    # See frontend/dashboard/README.md for more details
    ```
4.  **Set up the Java GUI:**
    ```bash
    cd gui/java
    ./compile_and_run.sh
    ```
