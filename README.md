## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port shown in terminal)

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server

## Usage

### Navigation
- **AI Overview**: Main dashboard showing all AI agents with their current status and performance
- **Improvements**: Track all improvements made to AI systems over time
- **Performance**: Detailed analytics and charts for performance monitoring

### Filtering
- Click on any AI card in the Overview to filter the Improvements and Performance views
- Use the navigation tabs to switch between different visualization modes

### Real-time Updates
The dashboard simulates real-time data updates showing:
- Current AI status changes
- New improvements being applied
- Performance metric fluctuations
- Trend analysis over time

## Data Structure

The visualization uses structured data including:
- **AI Agents**: Status, performance metrics, improvement counts, versions
- **Improvements**: Timeline, impact levels, before/after metrics
- **Performance Data**: Historical trends, comparative analysis

## Customization

### Adding New AIs
Edit `app/data/mockData.ts` to add new AI agents:

```typescript
{
  id: 'new-ai',
  name: 'New AI Agent',
  type: 'Strategy',
  status: 'active',
  description: 'Description of the new AI',
  performance: { accuracy: 85, winRate: 70, avgProfit: 150, efficiency: 88 },
  improvements: 15,
  lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString(),
  color: '#3b82f6',
  version: 'v1.0.0'
}
```

### Styling
The app uses a custom design system with:
- Dark theme optimized for data visualization
- Gradient backgrounds and glass-morphism effects
- Consistent color coding for different AI types
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
