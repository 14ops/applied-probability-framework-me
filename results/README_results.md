## üî¨ Mathematical Foundation

### Probability Calculations
- **Win Probability**: P(win) = C(safe_tiles, clicks) / C(total_tiles, clicks)
- **Expected Value**: EV = P(win) √ó payout - P(lose) √ó cost
- **Optimal Clicks**: Found by maximizing expected value

## üìä Key Metrics Explained

### Win Rate
- Percentage of simulations that resulted in a win (positive reward)
- Higher is generally better, but consider risk factors

### Average Reward
- Mean reward across all simulations
- Key metric for expected returns

### Threshold Compliance
- Percentage of simulations that achieved 2.12x minimum payout
- Measures adherence to specified minimum threshold

### Sharpe Ratio
- Risk-adjusted return metric: (Mean Return - Risk-free Rate) / Volatility
- Higher values indicate better risk-adjusted performance

### Click Efficiency
- Average reward per click made
- Measures how efficiently strategies use their clicks

## üîç Analysis and Interpretation

### Best Overall Strategy
- **Lelouch** typically performs best due to strategic planning and psychological elements
- **Aoi** often ranks second with analytical optimization
- **Takeshi** may have high variance but can achieve high rewards

### Risk-Reward Trade-offs
- **High Risk, High Reward**: Takeshi Kovacs, Lelouch
- **Balanced**: Aoi, Yuzu
- **Low Risk, Low Reward**: Kazuya

### 2.12x Threshold Analysis
- **Kazuya** typically has highest compliance due to conservative approach
- **Aoi** often has good compliance due to analytical optimization
- **Takeshi** may have lower compliance due to aggressive approach

## üéØ Recommendations

### For Conservative Players
- Use **Kazuya** strategy for capital preservation
- Expect lower returns but higher 2.12x compliance
- Good for risk-averse scenarios

### For Balanced Players
- Use **Aoi** or **Yuzu** strategies
- Good balance of risk and reward
- Moderate 2.12x compliance

### For Aggressive Players
- Use **Takeshi** or **Lelouch** strategies
- Higher potential returns but more variance
- May have lower 2.12x compliance

### For Strategic Players
- Use **Lelouch** strategy for complex scenarios
- Best overall performance in most conditions
- Good for long-term planning

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Random Number Generation
- All simulations use seeded random number generation for reproducibility
- Seeds are consistent across strategy comparisons

### Statistical Significance
- 10,000 simulations provide statistically significant results
- Confidence intervals can be calculated for key metrics

### Performance Optimization
- Parallel processing for faster execution
- Vectorized calculations where possible
- Memory-efficient result storage
